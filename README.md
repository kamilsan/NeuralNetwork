# Handwriting digit recognition

Second project for the OOP course. It will use a very simple, single hidden layer neural net, trained on MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. User will be able to choose hyperparameters' values for model's training, save the model to a file, load it and feed images into it to learn what digit they contain.

(work in progress)
