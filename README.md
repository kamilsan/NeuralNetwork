# Handwritten digit recognition

Second project for the OOP course. It uses a very simple, single hidden layer neural net, trained on MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits. User is able to choose hyperparameters' values for model's training, save the model to a file, load it and feed images into it to learn what digits they contain.
